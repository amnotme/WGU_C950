# Chapter 6

**Introduction to graphs**

Many items in the world are connected, such as computers on a network connected by wires, cities connected by roads, or people connected by friendship.

A ***graph*** is a data structure for representing connections among items, and consists of vertices connected by edges.

- A ***vertex*** (or node) represents an item in a graph.
- An ***edge*** represents a connection between two vertices in a graph.

**Adjacency and paths**

In a graph:

- Two vertices are ***adjacent*** if connected by an edge.
- A ***path*** is a sequence of edges leading from a source (starting) vertex to a destination (ending) vertex. The ***path length*** is the number of edges in the path.
- The ***distance*** between two vertices is the number of edges on the shortest path between those vertices.
